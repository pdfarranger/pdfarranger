This file aims at listing all GUI operation one should do to test the whole PDF Arranger
source code. Those tests must currently be done manually. May one day, they'll
be done with [Dogtail](https://gitlab.com/dogtail/dogtail) or another GUI testing framework.

As testing is done manually this list should remain as short as possible.
Duplicate tests should be avoided and each step should test as many features as
possible. This list was created using
[Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io).
